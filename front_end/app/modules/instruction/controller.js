Scott has taught approximately 10,000 lessons to 300 different students and helped his students win Club Championships, shoot career rounds and redefine their goals to levels his students would not have thought possible.

Still though, Scott is looking to be educated on the latest techniques and cutting edge technologies that could possibly help his students improve.
